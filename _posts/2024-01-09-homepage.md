This is a very basic physics simulation that I made to have a cool looking animation on <a href="/">this website's homepage</a>.

Particles move around bouncing off the edges of the container and each other. 
When they are close to one another a line connects them. The thickness of the line depends on how close the two particles are to each other.
This connects all of the particles in a interesting network pattern that changes over time as the particles move.

All of the movement logic is in javascript and is drawn to the screen using a html `<canvas>` element.
You can see a demo of it below.


### Demonstration
<div id="canvas-container">
    <canvas id="hero" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
</div>
